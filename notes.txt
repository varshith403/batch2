!Doctype is used for Document types declaration state

head is an invisible to the end user

js is linked using the script tag

The variables inside a function are refered as local variables

What is datatypes?
- datatypes is used to define what kind of data used in the variable.

types of datatypes:-
1. primitive data types
-  it can store single values
-  immutable
- primitive data types are :- 
    1.String
    2.Boolean
    3.number
    4.Undefined
    5.null
    6.bigInt
    7.Symbol
2. non-primitive datatypes
- it can store multiple values.
- mutable
- non-primitive datatypes :
    1.class
    2.objects
    3.functions
    4.arrays
    5. math, date, json


1. String :- sequence of characters stored within double quotes / single quotes/ backticks(templateliterals ``)
ex: var username = "Mahesh Babu";
    let title = 'super start';
    char networth = `120cr`;

    typeof(); method used to define the type of data

2. Boolean :- true / false.
    Re-declaration is not allowed.

3. number:- integers, float, decimal, exponential etx...
-2^53-1 to +2^53-1  bigInt range
 ex: let num = 10;
  let num2 = 12.233;
  let num3 = 10e4;

4. undefined:- variable is declared but value is  not defining/initialised.
     let a; 
    console.log(a);

5. null :- null is a abscence of object / empty space 
     but the datatype of null is still an object (bug)
    
    what is the return type of null ?  A: object


comment in js: -
1. single line comment (//)
2. multi line comment : (/**/)

Operators:
 - operators are special symbols which used to perform operation on operands. 
 ex:- 2(Operand1) +  2(operand2)

1. Unary  operator
2. Binary
3. Ternary (operanation ? statement1 : statement2);


1.1 Arithmatic :- Which performs oeprations such as 
    - Additon (concatenation)
    - Subtraction
    - multiplication
    - Division
    - modulus
    - exponential
    - 
    
1.2 Assignment
1.3 Relational 
1.4 Logical


decision making statements
if
if-else
swich
ternary condition

write a condition to check greatest numbers among 3 numbers

minimum iteration count is 0 for for loops and same for while loops 
minimum iteration count of do while loop is 1

functions:
-function is a building block of javascript
-function is a block of code which is used to execute specific task.
