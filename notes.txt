!Doctype is used for Document types declaration state

interpreter reads the code in javascript

head is an invisible to the end user

js is linked using the script tag

The variables inside a function are refered as local variables

What is datatypes?
- datatypes is used to define what kind of data used in the variable.

types of datatypes:-
1. primitive data types
-  it can store single values
-  immutable
- primitive data types are :- 
    1.String
    2.Boolean
    3.number
    4.Undefined
    5.null
    6.bigInt
    7.Symbol
2. non-primitive datatypes
- it can store multiple values.
- mutable
- non-primitive datatypes :
    1.class
    2.objects
    3.functions
    4.arrays
    5. math, date, json


1. String :- sequence of characters stored within double quotes / single quotes/ backticks(templateliterals ``)
ex: var username = "Mahesh Babu";
    let title = 'super start';
    char networth = `120cr`;

    typeof(); method used to define the type of data

2. Boolean :- true / false.
    Re-declaration is not allowed.

3. number:- integers, float, decimal, exponential etx...
-2^53-1 to +2^53-1  bigInt range
 ex: let num = 10;
  let num2 = 12.233;
  let num3 = 10e4;

4. undefined:- variable is declared but value is  not defining/initialised.
     let a; 
    console.log(a);

5. null :- null is a abscence of object / empty space 
     but the datatype of null is still an object (bug)
    
    what is the return type of null ?  A: object


comment in js: -
1. single line comment (//)
2. multi line comment : (/**/)

Operators:
 - operators are special symbols which used to perform operation on operands. 
 ex:- 2(Operand1) +  2(operand2)

1. Unary  operator
2. Binary
3. Ternary (operanation ? statement1 : statement2);


1.1 Arithmatic :- Which performs oeprations such as 
    - Additon (concatenation)
    - Subtraction
    - multiplication
    - Division
    - modulus
    - exponential
    - 
    
1.2 Assignment
1.3 Relational 
1.4 Logical


decision making statements
if
if-else
swich
ternary condition

write a condition to check greatest numbers among 3 numbers

minimum iteration count is 0 for for loops and same for while loops 
minimum iteration count of do while loop is 1

functions:
-function is a building block of javascript
-function is a block of code which is used to execute specific task.

syntax: function function_name(optional parameters,a){
                     //statements
                     }
                    function_name(arguments)

types of function:
1.named
2.anonymous
3.function expression
4.IIFE: it can be invoked only one time 
5.arrow function: it concise the normal function syntax
6.higher order function
7.callback function

map is similar to for loop and it is a built in methods of array

closure: closure is a memory created when functions are bundled together or nested each other by giving accessibility 
to the inner most function to 

Arrays:
-it is a non primitive data type
-array is used to store multiple values in a single variable

syntax []

object:
object is an entity which contains states and behaviors
states-properties , behavior - functionality
object is an entity to store the values in the form key and value pair

- Object is an entity which contains states and behaviors.
-states - properties , behaviour - functionality.
- Object is an entity to store the values in the form key and value pair.

synatax :-   let obj = {};
ex :-   let userdetails ={
        name:"Sam",
        age:23
        }

Note: - Javascript is mainly object -based language till 2015 (es6) 
- after es6 feature they added oops concept.

-json stands for javascript object notation
-json is a javascript technique used to transfer the data from client to server
-json object does not contains variables

json methods:
json.stringify()

async & await:
async: async keyword converts synchronous function into asynchronous function and starts the promise

Dom:
dom is a web api used to manipulate the html content 
dom is used to add , remove ,update the content in the html Document

Dom methods:
1.Document.getElementById("");
2.Document.getElementByClassName("");
3.Document.getElementByTagName("");
4.Document.getElementByName("");
5.Document.querySelector("");
6.Document.querySelectorAll("");

events in dom:

-events are nothing but an actions performed on the html element 
-in dom , we have events like cli
